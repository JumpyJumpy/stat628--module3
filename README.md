# STAT 628 Module 3
Yelp Data Project

## Objective
The objective of the project is to give analytic discussion on the caf√© 
businesses on Yelp by using data provided by Yelp, and to suggest practical and 
specific action plans for business owners to improve their business.

## Data


The raw datasets are in the format of `.json` and they are too large to be uploaded to GitHub, but they can be accessed at [https://uwmadison.box.com/s/8864nymigxb3r4g2u2o5s74xspsutlrd](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/8864nymigxb3r4g2u2o5s74xspsutlrd).
The [data]() folder contains 6 related dataset.
`business.csv` is part of the original data; `Attributes_advice.csv` is the data after splitting the attributes.
`tf_idf_words.csv` and `word_list.csv` contains the words selected by td-idf and words we care about selected from the tf-idf results.
`attributes.suggestions.csv` and  `suggestions.csv` contains our final general suggestions based on attributes and specific suggestions based on reviews.


## Code
All relavant codes are in [code]() folder. Codes are written in `Python` and `R`. 
- `attribute_frequency.py` read the `business.json` into a dataframe, flattened all nested columns, and write it to a `.csv` file.  
- `attributes_analysis.R`
